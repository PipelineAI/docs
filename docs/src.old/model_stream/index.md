## Continuous Model Predictions
PipelineAI's modular design allows your REST-based models to run natively within Kafka and Kinesis streams for continuous model predictions.

## Incremental Model Training 
PipelineAI supports continuous, incremental model training.  This is best described by Scikit-learn's [partial_fit()](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/scaling_strategies.html#incremental-learning) functionality.
