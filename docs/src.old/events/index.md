PipelineAI is the organizer and sponsor for the series of [Advanced Spark and TensorFlow Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Advanced-Spark-and-TensorFlow-Meetup/) with 20,000+ members throughout the world including the following cites:

* San Francisco
* Chicago
* New York
* Washington DC
* London
* Berlin
* Toronto
* Madrid 
* Beijing
* Chennai
* Bangalore
* Dubai

In 2016 alone, we hosted 60+ free meetup community events throughout the world.  

While this dedication to the community requires a large amount of human and financial capital, we continue to push forward with close to 100 global community events planned in 2017.

## [Workshops](/training/index.md)

### PipelineAI Distributed Spark ML + Tensorflow AI + GPU Workshop
_Everybody gets their own GPU for the duration of the workshop!!_

We will each build an end-to-end, continuous, distributed Spark ML and Tensorflow AI model training and deployment pipeline on our own GPU-based cloud instance.

The only prequisites are a modern browser and an internet connection. We provide the rest including a GPU-based cloud instance for each attendee.

At the end of the workshop, each attendee can download the Docker image and run everything in your own cloud account.

**Agenda**

* Spark ML
* TensorFlow AI
* Storing and Serving Models with HDFS
* Trade-offs of CPU vs. GPU, Scale Up vs. Scale Out
* CUDA + cuDNN GPU Development Overview
* TensorFlow Model Checkpointing, Saving, Exporting, and Importing
* Distributed TensorFlow AI Model Training (Distributed Tensorflow)
* TensorFlow's Accelerated Linear Algebra Framework (XLA)
* TensorFlow's Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler, Ahead of Time (AOT) Compiler
* Centralized Logging and Visualizing of Distributed TensorFlow Training (Tensorboard)
* Distributed Tensorflow AI Model Serving/Predicting (TensorFlow Serving)
* Centralized Logging and Metrics Collection (Prometheus, Grafana)
* Continuous TensorFow AI Model Deployment (TensorFlow, Airflow)
* Hybrid Cross-Cloud and On-Premise Deployments (Kubernetes)
* High-Performance and Fault-Tolerant Micro-services (NetflixOSS)
