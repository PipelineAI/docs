<body>Terms of Service

Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While PipelineAI prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that PipelineAI cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.

A. Account Terms
1. You must be 13 years or older to use this Service.
2. You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
3. You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.
4. Your login may only be used by one person - a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.
5. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. PipelineAI cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
6. You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when Content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).
7. One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.
8. You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).
9. You may not use this Service if you are a direct competitor, except with PipelineAI's prior written consent. You may not use or access the Service to compile data in a manner that is used or usable by a competitive product or service.

B. Use Terms
You expressly understand and agree that PipelineAI shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if PipelineAI has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the Services.

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to PipelineAI may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access. PipelineAI, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage. PipelineAI will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.

PipelineAI reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access with or without notice.

C. Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms
1. You are not required to provide a credit card number to open an account.
2. Once your free trial period has ended you will be required to enter a credit card to continue usage.
3. Any usage once you enter credit card information will immediately incur a usage charge.
4. PipelineAI calculates your server usage in seconds and bills you for that amount of usage at the prevailing rates displayed on our web site. We track your usage in seconds and charge you for the fraction of an hour that you used. So if you only use 5 minutes, you'll only be billed for 5 minutes. Please note that we will round each charge up to the nearest cent (so the minimum charge is 1 cent).
5. Roughly once a month, we will bill you for the usage charges you have accrued over the preceding month (unless other payment terms have been arranged).
6. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.
7. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. PipelineAI does not accept any liability for such loss.

D. Cancellation and Termination
You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. Contact contact@pipeline.ai for canceling your account.

PipelineAI, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other PipelineAI service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. PipelineAI reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time

E. Modification of the Services
PipelineAI reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

Prices of all Services, including but not limited to monthly subscription plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us (unless you have agreed otherwise with PipelineAI). Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the PipelineAI Site (Pipeline.io) or the Service itself.

PipelineAI shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

F. Copyright and Content Ownership
We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours. However, if you set your pages to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view your Content.

PipelineAI does not pre-screen Content, but PipelineAI and its designee have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or remove any Content that is available via the Service.

You shall defend PipelineAI against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against PipelineAI by a third party alleging that Your Content, or Your use of the Service in violation of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable law, and shall indemnify PipelineAI for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by, PipelineAI in connection with any such claim, demand, suit or proceeding; provided, that PipelineAI (a) promptly gives You written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (b) gives You sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases PipelineAI of all liability); and (c) provides to You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.
