        of God, war, fire, flood, accident, strike, casualty, power failures,<br>governmental acts, orders or restrictions or inability to obtain suitable and<br>sufficient labor and materials. The party invoking force majeure shall (a) send<br>written
        notice thereof to the other within a reasonable time after the invoking<br>party knew or should have known that performance would be delayed or prevented<br>due to the force majeure and (b) take reasonable steps to limit the duration<br>and effect
        of any such force majeure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>f. Waiver. The failure of a party to claim a breach of any term of this<br>License shall not constitute a waiver of such breach or the right of such party<br>to enforce any subsequent breach of such term.
        e. Assignment.&nbsp; Licensee shall not assign this License or any<br>of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of PIPELINEAI,<br>and any such prohibited assignment shall be null and void.&nbsp; PIPELINEAI may assign
        this License or any of<br>its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of<br>Licensee. f. Severability. In the event that any provision of this License is<br>found to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree
        that unless such<br>provision materially affects the intent and purpose of this License, such<br>invalidity, voidability or unenforceability shall not affect the validity of<br>this License nor the remaining provisions hereof. g. Third-Party Beneficiaries.<br>Licensee
